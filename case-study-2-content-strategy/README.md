## The Challenge

A B2B SaaS platform had strong brand awareness but weak organic search performance for mid-funnel queries. Content existed but lacked strategic organization:

- No pillar → cluster content structure
- Limited evergreen articles (mostly product updates)
- Trend coverage strong but not leveraged for long-tail authority
- Low internal-link density between related content
- Missing content for key buyer journey stages

## Interview Talking Points

### On Keyword Strategy
> "I identified that competitors were ranking for 'AI workflow tools' and 'productivity templates' while my client had no content targeting these terms. I built a keyword cluster around automation and productivity to capture this demand."

### On Content Architecture
> "I implemented a pillar/cluster model where one comprehensive pillar page ('Complete Guide to Workflow Automation') links to 8-10 supporting cluster articles. This builds topical authority and improves crawl efficiency."

### On Measurable Impact
> "Within 60 days, organic impressions increased 280% and blog traffic grew 300%. The key was targeting informational queries that lead to product consideration."

### On Process
> "I used SEMRush for keyword gap analysis, mapped keywords to buyer journey stages, then created a prioritized content calendar. Each piece was designed to rank independently while supporting the pillar page."
