## The Challenge

The Morning Brew Coffee Shop is a beloved local institution with excellent reviews and loyal customers — but they are **completely invisible online**:

- **No website** — Zero indexed pages on Google
- **No online ordering** — Missing revenue from pickup/delivery
- **No SEO presence** — Not ranking for "coffee near me" or any local queries
- **Facebook-only** — Entire digital presence relies on a single social platform
- **No loyalty system** — No way to capture customer data or drive repeat visits

Despite being the highest-rated coffee shop in their area (4.9★, 432 reviews), they lose customers to competitors who show up in Google searches.

## Interview Talking Points

Use these discussion starters when referencing this case study:

### On Local SEO Strategy
> "I identified a 4.9-star rated business with 432 reviews that was completely invisible online — no website, no SEO. I built a ground-up local SEO strategy targeting 'coffee near me' and location-specific keywords, with a phased 6-month roadmap."

### On Business Impact
> "The client was losing customers to lower-rated competitors who simply showed up in search. My proposal projected 200% visibility improvement and 15-25% foot traffic increase — with a website that would pay for itself through online ordering revenue."

### On Technical Implementation
> "I created ready-to-deploy LocalBusiness and Menu schema markup, ensuring the client would be eligible for rich results from day one. The schema includes opening hours, menu items, and geographic targeting."

### On Client Communication
> "I translated technical SEO recommendations into business language — the pitch focuses on revenue impact, not technical jargon. This is how I'd present to a CEO or small business owner who cares about results, not implementation details."
