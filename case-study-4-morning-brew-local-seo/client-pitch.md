# Digital Transformation Proposal: The Morning Brew Coffee Shop

**Prepared by:** Sage Nwanne, Digital Transformation Bureau  
**Date:** December 2024  
**For:** The Morning Brew Coffee Shop

---

## The Challenge

Your coffee shop is one of the highest-rated in East Stroudsburg — **4.9 stars with 432 reviews** — but customers can't find you online.

**Current Reality:**
- No website = invisible to Google searches
- "Coffee near me" searches go to competitors
- No online ordering = missed revenue during busy hours
- No customer database = no way to drive repeat visits
- 100% dependent on Facebook for digital presence

**The Problem:** You have the best product and reputation, but competitors with websites are capturing your potential customers.

---

## The Opportunity

Every month, thousands of people in your area search for:

| Search Query | Monthly Searches |
|--------------|------------------|
| "coffee near me" | 8,100 |
| "cafe near me" | 4,400 |
| "breakfast near me" | 3,200 |
| "coffee east stroudsburg" | 320 |

**You are currently invisible for ALL of these searches.**

With a proper digital foundation, you can capture this demand and convert searchers into customers.
