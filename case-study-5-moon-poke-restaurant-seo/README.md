## The Challenge

Moon Poke has a perfect 5.0-star rating and loyal customers, but their digital presence is **generic and dependent on third parties**:

- **Cookie-cutter website** — Template site with no SEO optimization
- **Third-party ordering** — MealKeyWay takes fees on every order
- **No structured data** — Missing rich snippets in search results
- **No brand story** — Website doesn't communicate unique value
- **No customer data** — Third-party owns the customer relationship

Despite excellent reviews, they're losing margin to platform fees and visibility to competitors with better SEO.

## The Opportunity

| Metric | Current State | Opportunity |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Organic search visibility | Minimal | Rank for 40+ restaurant keywords |
| Third-party fees | 15-20% per order | Reduce to 2-3% (payment processing only) |
| Customer data ownership | None | Full email/SMS list |
| Menu discoverability | Not indexed | Rich menu snippets in search |
| Brand differentiation | Generic | Unique story and visual identity |

## Interview Talking Points

Use these discussion starters when referencing this case study:

### On Platform Dependency Analysis
> "I identified that this client was losing $10,000+ annually to third-party ordering fees. MealKeyWay was taking 15-20% of every order while also owning the customer relationship. My strategy focused on migrating to first-party ordering to reclaim both margin and data."

### On ROI-Driven Strategy
> "The project pays for itself in year one. By reducing platform fees from 15-20% to 2.5% payment processing, the client saves $10,500 annually. Combined with projected order growth from better SEO visibility, year one value exceeds $25,000."

### On Technical SEO
> "I created Restaurant and Menu schema that makes the full menu indexable by search engines. This enables rich results showing menu items, prices, and dietary options directly in search — something their template site couldn't do."

### On Strategic Thinking
> "This wasn't just an SEO project — it was a business transformation. Moving from platform dependency to owned infrastructure means the client builds equity in their digital presence instead of renting it from a third party."

### On Multi-Phase Planning
> "I structured the engagement in three phases: Foundation (website + schema), Migration (first-party ordering), and Growth (loyalty + retention). Each phase delivers value independently while building toward the full vision."
