## The Challenge

Your restaurant has a **perfect 5.0-star rating** — but your digital infrastructure is costing you money and limiting growth.

**Current Reality:**
- Generic template website with minimal SEO
- MealKeyWay takes 15-20% of every online order
- No customer database — the platform owns your customers
- No structured data — missing rich snippets in search
- Competitors with custom sites are capturing your potential customers

**The Problem:** You're paying thousands in platform fees while being invisible in organic search.

| Metric | Estimate |
|--------|----------|
| Monthly online orders | 200-300 |
| Average order value | $25 |
| Monthly online revenue | $5,000-7,500 |
| Platform fees (15-20%) | **$750-1,500/month** |
| Annual platform fees | **$9,000-18,000** |

### What First-Party Ordering Saves You

| Scenario | Annual Cost |

## The Opportunity

Every month, thousands of people search for what you offer:

| Search Query | Monthly Searches |

| "poke bowl near me" | 14,800 |
| "sushi near me" | 40,500 |
| "boba tea near me" | 12,100 |
